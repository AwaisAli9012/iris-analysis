## 🎯 Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset and visualize feature relationships using Python libraries.

## 📊 Dataset Used
- Name: Iris Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features:
  - SepalLengthCm
  - SepalWidthCm
  - PetalLengthCm
  - PetalWidthCm
  - Species (target)

## 📉 Models Applied
- No ML model was applied in this task.
- Focus was on data visualization and statistical summary.

## 📈 Key Results and Findings
- Petal features show more variance across species than sepal features.
- Boxplots revealed clear separation and some outliers in certain features.
- Dataset has no missing values and is clean for further modeling.
- Visuals like scatter plots and histograms provided key insights into feature distribution.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
